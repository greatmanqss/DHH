# DHH
I'm very sorry that I am a little busy recently. I'll update the readme to give an introduction about the usage of the codes a few days later (no more than a week). 
Caffe implementation of our work entitled as "Deep Heterogeneous Hashing for Face Video Retrieval" (TIP under review). For research use only, commercial use is not allowed.

# Prerequisites
Linux 14.04 (We simply tried it on 16.06 or high version but failed due to MKL issue)

NVIDIA GPU + CUDA-7.5 or CUDA-8.0 and corresponding CuDNN

Caffe

BLAS lib: Intel MKL V2017.1.132

# Modification on Caffe

# Compiling
The compiling process is the same as caffe. You can refer to Caffe installation instructions.

# Datasets

# Training

# Evaluation

# Contact
If you have any problem about our code, feel free to contact shishi.qiao@vipl.ict.ac.cn or describe your problem in Issues.
